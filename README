here are the steps from the telegram website:
Obtaining api_id
In order to obtain an API id and develop your own application using the Telegram API you need to do the following:

Sign up for Telegram using any application.
Log in to your Telegram core: https://my.telegram.org.
Go to "API development tools" and fill out the form.
You will get basic addresses as well as the api_id and api_hash parameters required for user authorization.
For the moment each number can only have one api_id connected to it.

the website will look like this:
